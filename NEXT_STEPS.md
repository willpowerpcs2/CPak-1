# CPak Next Steps for Development

This guide will help you continue development on the CPak project after successfully migrating your Access database to PostgreSQL.

## 1. Export Your Database

Since you've already run the migration script and have a local PostgreSQL database, the next step is to export it so you can commit it to the repository.

### Troubleshooting Database Export

If you're having issues with the export script, try the following:

1. **Run the debug script first** to identify any issues:

```bash
python database/debug_export.py \
  --db-name cpak \
  --db-user <your-db-username> \
  --db-password <your-db-password> \
  --db-host localhost \
  --db-port 5432 \
  --output ./database_export
```

2. **Use the simplified export script** that doesn't rely on pg_dump:

```bash
python database/simple_export.py \
  --db-name cpak \
  --db-user <your-db-username> \
  --db-password <your-db-password> \
  --db-host localhost \
  --db-port 5432 \
  --output ./database_export
```

This will create:
- A schema.sql file with the database structure
- CSV files for each table in the database_export/csv directory

3. **Check the log files** for detailed error information:
   - debug_export.log
   - simple_export.log

## 2. Commit the Exported Database

After successfully exporting your database, commit it to the repository:

```bash
git add database_export/
git commit -m "Add exported database"
git push
```

## 3. Set Up the Backend

Now that you have your database exported, you can set up the backend:

```bash
cd backend
cp env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to include your database credentials:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=cpak
DB_USER=<your-db-username>
DB_PASSWORD=<your-db-password>
```

Then install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## 4. Set Up the Frontend

Set up the frontend in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 5. Development Workflow

Now you can continue development with the following workflow:

1. Make changes to the backend or frontend code
2. Test your changes locally
3. Commit your changes to the repository

## Common Issues and Solutions

### PostgreSQL Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting to PostgreSQL:

1. Make sure PostgreSQL is running:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   net start postgresql-x64-14
   
   # On macOS
   brew services start postgresql
   
   # On Linux
   sudo service postgresql start
   ```

2. Verify your database credentials:
   ```bash
   psql -U <your-db-username> -d cpak
   ```

### Missing Python Dependencies

If you're missing required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas psycopg2-binary
```

### pg_dump Not Found

If pg_dump is not found:

1. Make sure PostgreSQL client tools are installed
2. Add PostgreSQL bin directory to your PATH
3. Use the simple_export.py script instead, which doesn't rely on pg_dump

## Next Development Tasks

Here are some suggested next steps for development:

1. Review the database schema and make any necessary adjustments
2. Implement basic CRUD operations in the backend
3. Create frontend components for data display and manipulation
4. Implement user authentication
5. Add business logic specific to your application

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues, check the log files for detailed error messages:

- migration_execution.log - For migration issues
- debug_export.log - For database export debugging
- simple_export.log - For simplified export issues
