# Migration Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the CPak Access database to a web application.

## Migration Approaches

There are several approaches to migrating an Access database to a web application:

1. **Direct Migration**
   - Migrate the database schema and data directly to a new database system
   - Recreate forms, reports, and business logic in the web application
   - Pros: Clean implementation, optimized for web
   - Cons: Time-consuming, requires full rewrite

2. **Hybrid Migration**
   - Migrate the database to a new system
   - Keep the Access front-end temporarily
   - Gradually replace Access forms and reports with web interfaces
   - Pros: Phased approach, less disruption
   - Cons: Requires maintaining two systems temporarily

3. **Automated Migration**
   - Use tools to automatically convert Access forms to web forms
   - Pros: Faster implementation
   - Cons: Limited customization, may not follow best practices

## Recommended Approach

For the CPak migration, we recommend the **Direct Migration** approach for the following reasons:

1. It provides a clean implementation optimized for web
2. It allows for modernizing the UI/UX
3. It enables implementing modern security practices
4. It provides better scalability and performance

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning (2-4 weeks)
- Analyze the Access database structure
- Document tables, queries, forms, and reports
- Identify business logic and workflows
- Define requirements for the web application
- Select technology stack
- Create project plan and timeline

### Phase 2: Database Migration (2-3 weeks)
- Design the new database schema
- Create migration scripts
- Migrate data
- Validate data integrity

### Phase 3: Backend Development (4-6 weeks)
- Set up development environment
- Implement API endpoints
- Implement business logic
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Write tests

### Phase 4: Frontend Development (4-6 weeks)
- Set up development environment
- Implement UI components
- Implement forms and reports
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Write tests

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation (2-3 weeks)
- Perform unit testing
- Perform integration testing
- Perform user acceptance testing
- Fix bugs and issues

### Phase 6: Deployment and Training (1-2 weeks)
- Deploy the web application
- Train users
- Provide documentation
- Monitor and support

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data loss during migration | High | Low | Create backups, validate data after migration |
| Missing business logic | High | Medium | Thorough analysis, user validation |
| User resistance | Medium | Medium | User involvement, training, support |
| Performance issues | Medium | Low | Performance testing, optimization |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security testing, best practices |

## Success Criteria

1. All data successfully migrated with integrity
2. All business functions implemented in the web application
3. User acceptance and adoption
4. Improved performance and scalability
5. Enhanced security and access control
